	Recently, Inter net of Things (IoT) has proliferated, leading to the development and deployment of several types of
IoT networks at the edge that connect to the back-end cloud to provide advanced features for several emerging
applications, such as crow d analytics and environmental monitoring. Such IoT networ ks consist of diverse types of
elements, e.g., sensors, actuators, gateways, controllers and networking r outers. They have diverse characteristics
and they need to be com posed and configured to be operated under different constraints imposed by the
applications and underlying infrastructures. Via IoT networks, we can construct a close-loop by which we can
perceive physical processes, react against incidents, and even control the development of the processes. Such tight
interactions of computation and physical processes are fundamental in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To achieve a
resilient CPS, we are facing 5 challenges to be addressed: dependability, consistency, reliability, cyber-physical
mismatch, and cyberâ€“physical coupling security. The goal of this project is to research and develop basic
abstractions and their corresponding techniques for developing advanced models of IoT networks for resilient CPS. 
Such advanced models are configurable and constrained by different types of interactions , such as, passive and
proactive sensing or near-realtime close control feedbacks between cyber and physical processes, and quality
attributes, such as performance, response time, privacy constraints, near real-time interactions, to name just a few. In this project we will focus on the following topics:
	<ul>
	  <li> Study scenarios required advanced models of IoT networks, especially focusing on scenarios in China </li>
	  <li> Study IoT element characteristics, IoT network configurations and their interdependencies.</li>
<li> Define advanced models of IoT networ ks, interaction and quality constraints for advanced models of IoT
networks. </li>
<li> Model and optimize advanced models of IoT networks with these constraints.</li>
</ul>
